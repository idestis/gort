![Moving Gopher as GORT](./assets/gort.png)

**GORT** is a simple HTTP handler to receive remote calls to run scripts bundled in Docker containers. Why the name is `gort` -  because the idea is "GO-Run-Things"

**Safety notice:** Until this tool doesn't have the authorization, you need to cover it using any firewalls or use it as internal service in your k8s cluster without exposing it outside.

## Usage

> Refer to [Install](#Install) for getting `gort` binary

To use `gort` in your Docker container download the latest version from [Project Release Page](https://github.com/idestis/gort/releases)

```bash
$ ./gort
2019/10/30 12:32:06 Gort is started on port 5000
```

**GORT** uses the following environment variables for a customized run

`PORT` as default will be handled over **5000** port

`SCRIPTS_DIR` by default will search scripts at **./dist** in the same directory where the binary

`GORT_RATE_LIMIT` is a parameter to set Throttle Limit, Throttle is not a rate-limiter per user. Instead, it just puts a ceiling on the number of current in-flight requests

The function will be executed in the background. Refer to container logs to see the output
```

## Install

### Binary

Binary are available for download on the [Project Release Page](https://github.com/idestis/gort/releases)

However, you also able to change something in the source code and build your ``Gort`` for yourself

```bash
$ go build ./...
```

## Use cases

## Dockerfile Example Usage

For instance, we have a few crawlers which should be executed on demand.

They was built by NPM

```Dockerfile
#
# STEP ONE: Build scripts
#
FROM node:10 AS builder
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy our files inside of the docker builder
COPY . .
# Install dependencies
RUN npm install && npm build
#
# STEP TWO: Build our images bundled with gort and copy scripts from builder
#
FROM alpine
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app
# Install dependecies
RUN apk add --no-cache bash nodejs ca-certificates && \
    wget https://github.com/idestis/gort/releases/download/1.0.0/gort_1.0.0_linux_amd64 -O gort && \
    chmod +x gort
# Copy our scripts from builder step
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app/dist
# PORT variable for Gort
ENV PORT 8080
# Expose outside
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ['gort']
```

After when we published and executed this docker container elsewhere, we can send requests to start any our function

```bash
$ curl -X POST https://address/v1/start -d '{"executor":"python", "script": "example.py"}'
The function will be executed in the background. Refer to container logs to see the output
```

In `STDOUT` of the container we will be able to see logs

```bash
2019/10/30 12:19:01 Just ran subprocess of example.py with PID 52177
```

For instance, you can schedule this runs using your services or any CI tool like Jenkins, [drone.io](https://drone.io)
